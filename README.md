# Playwright UI Tests

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of UI tests developed using the Playwright framework in .NET (C#). The tests are designed to validate the functionality and behavior of the web application [https://commitquality.com/](https://commitquality.com/). The purpose of these tests is to ensure the quality and reliability of the web application through automated testing.

## Features
-   **Assert:** This folder contains all the necessary assert methods that are used to perform assertions in the designed tests. 
    
-   **PageObject:** The PageObject folder houses the Page Object Model (POM) classes for each screen or page of the application. Each POM class represents a specific screen and encapsulates the related elements and actions that can be performed on that screen. 
    
-   **Test:** The Test folder holds the test cases that are specifically related to each screen of the application. Each test case is designed to validate a particular functionality or scenario on the corresponding screen. These tests utilize the Page Object Model and necessary assert methods to perform the required actions and assertions.
